# Odin-recipes

This is the first project while learning from the Odin Project.

In this project we'll write a short html webpage, with links in it to recipes across the internet. While doing the webpage,
I will have to use some of the learned skills, such as making the html boilerplate, how to use Terminal, git, and some html keywords.
