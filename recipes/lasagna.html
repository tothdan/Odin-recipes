    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
    Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. 
    It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.
    Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. 
    Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
